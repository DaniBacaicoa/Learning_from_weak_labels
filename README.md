# Learning from weak labels
Repository for learning from weakly labeld data and comparison of different methodologies.

I have specified in some of the scripts that certain parts of this code are partially based on the work of [Orieus](https://github.com/Orieus) and [perellonieto](https://github.com/perellonieto) and [palm-ml](https://github.com/palm-ml). Credit and thanks to them!.
